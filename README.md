## More details on the error

The "maximum call stack size" error appears when Cally [attempts to focus](https://github.com/WickyNilliams/cally/blob/38e6a7bc7c53e29c427f5de028b8544e2bff9a9d/src/calendar-month/calendar-month.tsx#L23) to focus the button for currently selected date. This logic runs when the month is focused.

If focus events bubbled, then I could see why this error would occur. The button's focus event would bubble up to the month, which would trigger another button focus, which would trigger another month focus, which would trigger another button focus, etc.

My understanding is that [focus events don't bubble](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/focus_event), so I'm confused as to why this loop would occur. Is it possible that something in Storybook is causing focus events to bubble?
